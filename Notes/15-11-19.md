# Ansible Inventories


* Ansible works against multiple nodes or “hosts” for  your infrastructure at the same time.
* By using a list or group of lists know as inventory. 
* Once your inventory is defined, you can use to select the hosts or groups you can run  Ansible commands.
* Ansible uses a combination of a hosts file and a group_vars directory to pull variables per host group and run Ansible plays/tasks against hosts.
* The default location for inventory is a file called /etc/ansible/hosts.
* We can be called  from a different host  file  by using  -i
* You can also use multiple inventory files at the same time.
* we can add hosts with private ip or public ip or public Dns or private dns or domain name or host names.


## Inventories are two types:


* Satic 
* Dynamic


## Static Inventory:

* Manually we have to add or remove  hosts in inventory file

```

[webservers]
foo.example.com
bar.example.com

[dbservers]
one.example.com
two.example.com

```



# Ansible Variables:


* It helps you to use and assign a value to a variable and use that anywhere in the playbook. 

* One can put conditions around the value of the variables and accordingly use them in the playbook.
