##  Ansible Modules

* Ansible  with a number of modules 
* Modules are discrete units of code that can be used from the command line or in a playbook task.
* Ansible executes each module, usually on the remote target node, and collects return values.
* Each module supports taking arguments. Nearly all modules take key=value arguments, space delimited. 
* Some modules take no arguments, and the command/shell modules simply take the string of the command you want to run.


### Example
```
yum 
Apt
service
Get_url 
 …….. etc
And can write own module.


```


## Ansible Facts

* Ansible facts is a way of getting the information of Hosts(nodes)
* This module is automatically called by playbooks to gather useful variables about remote hosts that can be used in playbooks. 
* It can also be executed directly by /usr/bin/ansible to check what variables are available to a hosts. Ansible provides many facts about the system, automatically.
* This module is also supported for Windows targets.
* It’s not always required 

```
$ ansible all -i myhosts -m setup -a  “filter=*family*”

Note: Gather_facts default value  is yes,
