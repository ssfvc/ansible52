# CICD:
* Version control : GIT
* Build tool          : Maven
* CI                     : Jenkins
* CD                   : Jfrog(Artifacts/Release)
* Code Analysis  :  SonarQube


## By Using Version control:
 * We can maintain versions for every change.
 * We Can go back older versions at any point of time
 * We can do auto merge(if it is possible)
 * We can able create branches for our applications

 ```
Staging area     : git add -A
Local Repo       : git commit -m “ comment”
Remote Repo   : git push

 ```

## Git Branches are Two types:
* Customer Branch
* Release Branch
